    Scenario Outline: Successful payment initiation request for single payments (embedded)
        Given PSU wants to initiate a single payment <single-payment> using the payment service <payment-service> and the payment product <payment-product>
        When PSU sends the single payment initiating request
        Then a successful response code and the appropriate authentication URL is delivered to the PSU
        Examples:
            | payment-service | payment-product       | single-payment                |
            | payments        | sepa-credit-transfers | singlePayInit-successful.json |


    Scenario Outline: Failed payment initiation request for single payments (embedded)
        Given PSU initiates an errorful single payment <single-payment> using the payment service <payment-service> and the payment product <payment-product>
        When PSU sends the single payment initiating request with error
        Then an error response code and the appropriate error response are received
        Examples:
            | payment-service     | payment-product       | single-payment                                 |
